# CountUpApp
Number label will go up from 0 when you hit plus/minus button down below label. Once the number is more than 10, color of number label will turn to yellow. When it's less than 0 it will go back to white.
And when the number is multiple 3, it will react like "世界のナベアツ（sekai-no-nabeatsu）" saying "ふぇえぇぇ！！"
